### Installing for Production Usage

If you clone or download this repo directly it will not run as a plugin inside WordPress! Installable production releases are available in on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/releases). You can get the latest stable release from [WordPress.org](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/lifterlms.zip)

### Installing for Development

1. Composer
  + `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
  + `php composer.phar install`

2. Node
  + Install node
  + Install npm
  + `npm install --global gulp`
  + `npm install`


### Coding Standards

For standards we're working off a modified version of the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/).

We're utilizing (a currently slightly modified version of) the [WordPress Coding Standards Core Ruleset](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) for PHPCS (php codesniffing).

Our javascript and SCSS are a mess. We're tackling that next.


### Running phpcs

Use the shorthand composer script to run phpcs against all PHP files.

+ `composer run-script phpcs`

Alternatively access the executable:

+ `./vendor/bin/phpcs path/to/file.php`

To see errors only (no warnings):

+ `./vendor/bin/phpcs -n path/to/file.php`

To see all options:

+ `./vendor/bin/phpcs -h`


### Running phpcbf

+ `./vendor/bin/phpcbf` to run on all php files
+ `./vendor/bin/phpcbf path/to/file.php` to run on a specific file
